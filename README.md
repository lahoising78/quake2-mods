<h3>About the mod</h3>
<p>
	In this mod you will be able to play as three warframe: Rhino, Nova and Volt.
	You can choose which warframe to play by selecting the difficulty of the game.
	To play <strong>rhino</strong>, play on easy. To play <strong>Nova</strong>, play on Medium. To play <strong>Volt</strong>, play on hard.
	Note that Volt does not have all four of his original abilities.
